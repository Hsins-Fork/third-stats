## Get started

Install ThirdStats from the Thunderbird Add-ons repository:

1. Open the menu and click Add-ons
2. Search for *ThirdStats*
3. Click *Add to Thunderbird* and enjoy your email account stats

To properly recognize emails as *sent*, make sure to configure all email adresses you write from as identities for your email account. You can do so under *account settings* > select your account > click button *more identities* at the bottom and add or modify identities as you need.

Also keep in mind, that the processing of large mailboxes can take a lot of time.

## Features

- Total numbers of emails and folders for all of your Thunderbird accounts
- Sum of received and sent emails per year and per month
- Sum of received and sent emails per daytime and per weekday
- Temporal distribution of received and sent emails per weekday per hour
- Switch between all Thunderbird accounts

Here is how ThirdStats looks like an the Thunderbird default dark theme:
